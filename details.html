									<h1>Where do we base ourselves?</h1>
									<p>I have two options for how we organise this trip. We can discuss which we prefer and I will update the website as we go along.</p>
								</header>
								<!--<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>-->
								<p>Option 1: We stay in Munich. This is the most obvious choice, Munich is the largest city in Bavaria, it has a lot going on. It is also where Oktoberfest is happening, so we only have to take local transport or a taxi to get to and from the event. It is also served by Munich Airport, where most of you will likely fly into. It is also closer to Neuschwanstein Castle than my other option. However, accommodation (among other things) will be VERY expensive.</p>
								<p>Option 2: We stay in Ingolstadt. This is the cheaper option, although not necessarily cheap. You will get an opportunity to see the city I will have been living in for four years, it is also right in the middle of Bavaria which gives us the option to visit other places if Neuschwanstein is not your cup of tea. Nuremberg Airport is also a good option to fly into and it is only one hour from Ingolstadt instead of two hours from Munich. The downsides are that Ingolstadt is rather small, there isn't too much going on, and we would have to take a one hour train to and from Munich to get to Oktoberfest.</p>

									<h1>Airport Information</h1>
									<p>Here is a map and some information about the airports around Munich to help you decide.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/bavariamap.png" alt="labelled map of bavaria" /> </div>
								<p>Aiports are marked with the purple aeroplane icon, the blue beer icons are Ingolstadt and Munich, the blue star icons are the main attractions I proposed and the yellow stars are alternative places to visit.</p>
								<p>NUE - Nuremberg Airport. Served by daily RyanAir flights from Stanstead. There are regular trains to Ingolstadt (~1 hour) and Munich (~2 hours).</p>
								<p>MUC - Munich Airport. Served by flights from Gatwick (Daily easyJet), Heathrow (Daily BA and Lufthansa), Birmingham (Daily Lufthansa and Lufthansa City), Manchester (Daily Lufthansa and Lufthansa City, every other Day easyJet), Edinburgh (Daily Lufthansa, 3x a week easyJet). There is an S-Bahn to the city centre every 10 minutes (~40 mins) and for Ingolstadt you can take a (~1 hour) train from the city centre or a (~1 hour) bus from the airport.</p>
								<p>FMM - Memmingen Airport. Served by daily RyanAir flights from Stanstead, or 2x a week RyanAir flights from Manchester. Trains to Munich are ~1.5 hours and to Ingolstadt it's ~3 hours.</p>
								<p>SZG - Salzburg Airport. Served by BA flgihts from Gatwick 3x per week or RyanAir/RyanAirUK flights from Stanstead 4x per week. Trains to Munich are ~2 hours.</p>
								<p>I wouldn't recommend Memmingen or Salzburg, I just included them for information. All train times are for regional trains which have fixed price tickets, high-speed trains may be faster (probably not by much on these routes) but prices are unpredictable. I would recommend purchasing a "Bayern Ticket" which covers all local transport and regional trains (excludes bus from MUC to Ingolstadt and high-speed trains) from 9am until 3am the following day. The current price is €32 for one person and an extra €10 per additional person up to a maximum of 5 people total.</p>
